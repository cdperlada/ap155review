#1.1a
#A. The Gravitational force is given by $$\tag{1}F = \frac{GmM}{r^2}$$ where $ G = 6.67 x 10^{-11} m^3 kg^{-1} s^{-2} $ is Newton's gravitational constant, $ M = 5.97 x 10^{24} kg $ is the mass of the earth, $m$ is the mass of the satellite and $r$ is the distance separation of the center of the earth and satellite.
#Note that $r$ is given by $$\tag{2}r = R+h$$ where $R = 6371 km$ is the radius of the earth and $h$ is the altitude of the satellite.The centripetal force is given by $$\tag{3} F = \frac{mv^2}{r}.$$ We can write $v$ as $$\tag{4}v = \frac{2 \pi r}{T}.$$ Eq(3) becomes $$\tag{5}F = \frac{4m \pi^2 r}{T^2}$$
#Equating (1) and (5), $$\tag{6}\frac{GmM}{r^2} = \frac{4m \pi^2 r}{T^2}$$ $$\tag{7}r^3=\frac{GMT^2}{4 \pi^2}$$ $$\tag{8}r={\left(\frac{GMT^2}{4 \pi^2}\right)}^{1/3}$$
#Substitute (2) to (8) $$\tag{9}h+R={\left(\frac{GMT^2}{4 \pi^2}\right)}^{1/3}$$ $$\tag{10}h={\left(\frac{GMT^2}{4 \pi^2}\right)}^{1/3}- R$$
#Thus, the altitude $h$ above the Earthâ€™s surface that the satellite must have is $$h={\left(\frac{GMT^2}{4 \pi^2}\right)}^{1/3}- R.$$
